# Homelab tools

`homelab-fmt` keeps the YAML in the homelab GitOps repositories in a
consistent key order and blank-line layout. It is a single static binary with
no runtime. Indentation, wrapping and quoting are left to
[oxfmt](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/formatter) in the editor.

The order comes from [templates](internal/templates/bundled): example
documents laid out the way formatted files should look.

| Template | Formats |
| --- | --- |
| [`app-template.yaml`](internal/templates/bundled/app-template.yaml) | bjw-s app-template values |
| [`kubernetes.yaml`](internal/templates/bundled/kubernetes.yaml) | top-level fields and `metadata` of every Kubernetes object |
| [`helm-release.yaml`](internal/templates/bundled/helm-release.yaml) | Flux `HelmRelease` |
| [`flux-kustomization.yaml`](internal/templates/bundled/flux-kustomization.yaml) | Flux `Kustomization` |
| [`kustomization.yaml`](internal/templates/bundled/kustomization.yaml), [`kustomize-component.yaml`](internal/templates/bundled/kustomize-component.yaml) | kustomize `Kustomization` and `Component` |

How it edits:

- It moves whole lines, so scalars, quoting, indentation and comments are
  never re-printed. Output that oxfmt accepted stays accepted.
- Comments directly above a key move with it; blank lines and detached
  comments stay where they were. The comment at the top of a document (such
  as the schema modeline) stays on top.
- SOPS files (`*.sops.*`, or a top-level `sops:` key) are never touched.
- A mapping stays unsorted, with a warning, when sorting would move a YAML
  alias above its anchor.
- The result must parse to the same data as the input, or the file is
  reported as an error and left unchanged.

## Usage

```sh
homelab-fmt                      # format every YAML file Git does not ignore
homelab-fmt --check              # list files that need formatting
homelab-fmt a.yaml b.md          # format only these; non-YAML paths are skipped
homelab-fmt explain a.yaml       # show the template and rule for each mapping
```

The exit status is 1 when `--check` finds files that need formatting and 2 on
errors.

## Templates

A template is one YAML document. Its values are placeholders; only its keys,
blank lines and `homelab-fmt` comments matter.

- **Order.** Keys are ordered as in the template. Keys it does not list keep
  their relative order after the listed ones.
- **Wildcards.** A `"*"` key stands for any key, such as each controller under
  `controllers`. A named key next to it wins for that name. In a list, the
  first item describes every item. Put `"*"` last in its mapping.
- **Wildcard examples.** Keys starting with `*`, such as `"*nfs"` and
  `"*emptyDir"`, are wildcards too. Use several when one example cannot stay
  valid against the schema, as with app-template persistence types. Their
  orders are merged: a key from a later example goes right before the next key
  the examples share.
- **Blank lines.** A blank line between two keys requires a blank line after
  the first one. A missing blank line requires nothing. Keys the template does
  not list are separated from the listed ones by a blank line, unless the
  mapping is `compact`.
- **Directives** go in a comment on a key's line and apply to the mapping
  under that key:
  - `# homelab-fmt: sort` sorts the keys the template does not list.
  - `# homelab-fmt: compact` removes blank lines between the entries.
  - `# homelab-fmt: separate` requires a blank line between the entries.

  Several directives can share a comment, separated by commas.

Header comments, above the first key, select documents and layer templates:

- `# homelab-fmt: schema <glob>` matches documents whose
  `yaml-language-server` `$schema` URL matches the glob, where `*` matches
  anything.
- Without `schema`, the template's `apiVersion` group and `kind` select
  documents. The version is ignored, and `"*"` matches any value.
- Each document uses the single most specific template: `schema`, then group
  and kind, then templates with wildcards.
- `# homelab-fmt: extends <template>` adds another template's rules. For a
  mapping both describe, the child's keys come first, followed by the parent's
  keys the child does not list.

To change the order, edit the template. To support a new kind, add a template,
usually extending `kubernetes.yaml`. Keep templates valid against their
schema, with a `yaml-language-server` modeline where one exists. Tests check
that every template loads, selects itself, formats to itself and is restored
after its mappings are shuffled.

## Installing in a consumer repository

Releases publish binaries for Linux, macOS and Windows with build provenance
attestations, which mise verifies. Pin a release in the repository's
`mise.toml`:

```toml
[tools]
"github:JacobSartin/homelab-tools" = "0.1.0"
```

To format on save in VS Code, keep oxfmt as the YAML formatter and run
`homelab-fmt` after each save with the
[Run on Save](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emeraldwalk.RunOnSave)
extension. VS Code must see mise's shims on `PATH`.

```json
"emeraldwalk.runonsave": {
  "commands": [{ "match": "\\.ya?ml$", "cmd": "homelab-fmt \"${file}\"" }]
}
```

## Layout

- [`cmd/homelab-fmt`](cmd/homelab-fmt): command-line interface.
- [`internal/templates`](internal/templates): loads the bundled templates,
  compiles them to rules, layers `extends` chains and picks one per document.
- [`internal/format`](internal/format): `Format` and `Explain`; fixture pairs
  in `testdata/<name>.in.yaml` / `<name>.out.yaml`.
- [`internal/rules`](internal/rules): the rule model (path, order, spacing),
  path matching and natural sort.
- [`internal/yamltext`](internal/yamltext): block mappings as line ranges.
- [`internal/files`](internal/files): discovery through `git ls-files` and
  explicit-path selection.

## Development

```sh
go test ./...
go run ./cmd/homelab-fmt --check   # from a consumer repository root
```

Pushing a `v*` tag runs [the release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yaml),
which tests, builds with GoReleaser and attests the archives.
